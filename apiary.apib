Mapping is a simple API to retrieve a value from a given key value, from onebox domain to an external one and also from external to onebox. The returned value is a free text that can be another key or a simple final value.

## Integration mappings Collection [/{entityId}/attributes/{attributeId}/integration-mappings/{oneboxKey}]

### Retrieve an External mapping [GET]

To retrieve an external value mapping from a given Onebox key and atribute domain.

+ Parameters

    + entityId (required, string) ... Onebox entity id, can be a promoter, a venue, etc
    + attributeId (required, enum[string])
      To indicate the kind of mapping you would obtain:
        + Members
          + `price_levels` - Filter by price levels.
